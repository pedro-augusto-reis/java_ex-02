#### Module: Bean Life Cycle
"_The life cycle of a Spring bean is easy to understand. When a bean is instantiated, it may be required to perform some initialization to get it into a usable state.   
Similarly, when the bean is no longer required and is removed from the container, some cleanup may be required._"
