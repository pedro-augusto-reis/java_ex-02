#### Goal
* This project is my studying practices for Spring basics.
* To demonstrate simple configurations to help understanding Spring basics.  
* This content was made using the material from **in28minutes** (I highly recommend to buy his material), study from articles, documentations and blogs posts.

#### Project
* This project will be organized using packages. Each package will elaborate a specific content.  
It is recommended to follow the order.
1. [Dependency Injetion - DI](src/main/java/com/http418/spring/di/README.md)
    * dependency injection using the spring annotations and comparing with a standard implementation 
    (without spring)
2. [Scope](src/main/java/com/http418/spring/scope/README.md)
    * introduction to spring scopes. How the application context manipulate the beans scope.
3. [Component Scan](src/main/java/com/http418/spring/componentscan/README.md)
    * spring ioc container bean search
4. [Bean Life Cycle](src/main/java/com/http418/spring/lifecycle/README.md)
    * bean implementations for life cycle configurations
5. [CDI annotations](src/main/java/com/http418/spring/cdi/README.md)
    * how implement Java CDI with spring. Spring implements CDI.
6. [Spring without Spring-Boot](src/main/java/com/http418/spring/springnoboot/README.md)
    * in the previous modules we were implementing spring using spring boot. Here we show how to configure
    spring without the use of the spring-boot project.
7. [Spring without annotations - XML](src/main/java/com/http418/spring/xmlnoannotation/README.md)
    * example of implementaions of spring using xml configure file
8. [Propertie](src/main/java/com/http418/spring/propertie/README.md)
    * get values from a propertie file
9. [Test](src/main/java/com/http418/spring/test/README.md)
    * unity tests examples
