#### Module: Component Scan
* Basically, it consist in telling spring ioc container where to look for spring components
* Spring will scan classes annotated with
    * @Component
    * @Controller
    * @Service
    * @Repository
    
In this example we created two packages that are at the same root level. The package "a" don't know
about the package "b".
