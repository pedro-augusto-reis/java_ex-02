#### Module: Propertie
* In this module it is demonstrated an example to get a value from a propetie file.  
This could be used when you need differents values depending on the environment yyour application is working. For example, 
if you have an specific configuration for a production environment and a different one for development.
* In this step we created the file, [someExternalServiceExample.properties](../../../../../resources/someExternalServiceExample.properties).
    * You can create the file outside your project.
